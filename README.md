*Made 100% in Typescript*

Algorithm for getting RFC(Federal Taxpayer Register) and CURP(Unique Population Registry Code) for México, implemented in Typescript.

*Note: The last character of the CURP is randomly picked at the moment of generating the curp the first time by national authorities, so we cannot calcute it realiably.*
